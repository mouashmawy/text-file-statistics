Top 10 Smartphone Usage Statistics UK:
1- 87% of adults in the UK owned smartphones in 2020.
2- The mobile internet penetration rate in the UK was 72% in 2020.
3- An average person in the UK spends 148 minutes on a smartphone.
4- Smartphones make up to 47.3% of online traffic in the UK.
5- The UK has the second-highest smartphone penetration rate in the world at 78.9%.
6- Email correspondence using a mobile phone was the most frequent activity among internet services in the UK. 
7- In January 2021, 97.5% of people in the UK used a smartphone to access their social media platforms.
8- 46% of people in the survey said that they use smartphones more than before Pandemic.
9- 100% of people in Generation Z use mobile phones.
10- As of 2021, 54.79% of the mobile vendor market share in the UK belongs to Apple.

A recent Pew Report (Mobile Fact Sheet – 5 February, 2018) shared some great data on the devices the US population are using. It is shown that by early 2018, 95% of the US population had a mobile phone, with nearly 80% of the population having a smartphone.

Several key trends are clear and important.

1. Mobile phones are ubiquitous – nearly everybody has one.
2. Smartphones are really common, but over one-fifth of the population does NOT have one.
3. The ownership and use of desktop/laptop computers has plateaued at about 70-75%.
4. Tablets are still growing, and may overtake desktop/laptop computers soon.
5. E-readers seem to be stuck at 20% of the population – and perhaps that will fall when the ones currently in use break?

Digging into the data
The report from Pew has some great nuggets relating to differences by groups. For example, smartphone ownership amongst the over 65 year olds is less than 50% (46%). Ownership of smartphones is over 90% for the under thirties, college graduates, and those earning over $75,000 a year.

The report highlights a very important group for market researchers, people who have a smartphone but who do not have broadband at home, i.e. they are unlikely to be able to take surveys on a desktop/laptop computer. Across the whole population this group is just 12% of the population. But amongst some groups the figure is considerably higher:

1- Did not graduate high school, 27%
2- Hispanic, 23%
3- Earns less than $30,000 a year, 21%
4- 18 to 29 years old, 17%

Lessons for other countries?
This data is from the USA and highlights trends that are common in many other countries. For example, mobile phones are becoming ubiquitous, smartphones are common but (in most countries) not everybody has one, smartphones are outstripping desktop/laptop computers (and tablets are catching up too). However, in many countries, the dependence on smartphones is much higher than in the USA.

The main message is that the mid-term future for market research is smartphone, but in the short-term, remember that not everybody has one. As for the long term, we have no idea what the next generation of devices after smartphones will be.
